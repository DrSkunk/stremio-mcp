### Troubleshooting Commands

If something isn't working, you can ask Claude to help:

```

Claude: Let me help troubleshoot:

1. Check if Android TV is reachable
2. Verify ADB connection
3. Check if Stremio is installed
4. Verify configuration

Try these commands in your terminal:
- adb devices (should show your TV)
- adb shell pm list packages | grep stremio (should show Stremio package)
```

## Common Patterns

### Watch History

```
Session 1:
User: Play Inception
[Watches movie]

Session 2 (later):
User: Continue where I left off
Claude: Note - This MCP can start content but cannot track playback position.
Stremio should remember your position automatically when you open it.
```

### Multiple Users

```
User 1: Play a kids movie
Claude: [Plays kid-friendly content]

User 2: Play The Office
Claude: [Switches to The Office]
```

## Limitations to Keep in Mind

1. **Cannot Control Playback**: Once content starts, you cannot pause/resume via MCP
2. **No Status Queries**: Cannot ask "what's currently playing?"
3. **Requires Addons**: Content must be available in your Stremio addons
4. **No Queue Management**: Cannot create playlists or queues

For these features, you'll need to use your Android TV remote or Stremio's mobile app.
